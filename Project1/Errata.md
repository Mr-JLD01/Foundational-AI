You are free to use my code from the LinearRegression example to download, format, and standardize the data

Other Notes:

- You are allowed (and encouraged) to converse with other students about the project, in order to better work through challenges you are having, but do not directly share code.

- I have made the RMSProp part of the project optional for bonus for all students (5%).
